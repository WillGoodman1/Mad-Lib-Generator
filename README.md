# Mad-Lib-Generator
Project #1: User is asked for 17 total inputs, such as adjectives and nouns, and is shown an output of a mad lib.

Embarking on a Journey to become a fully fledged software developper. In asking for advice I've ascertained that doing projects as a method of learning
is pretty useful! Not to mention rewarding as well. I've found a website with 42 suggestions and am going to work my way through them. 
Here is my first project, a mad lib generator.

What did I learn? 
  - How to take inputs from a user
  - How to print an output
  - How to add up different things (maybe by thing I mean string but I'm not sure) within a "print" bracket
  - How to push a local code onto my github
  - What a readme.md is
  - How to make get github PAT
  - That stack overflow is very helpful (so far at least)

How could I make this better?
  - I could add additional mad libs and find a way to randomly present one of them to the user, so that the same code could deliver more than just on mad lib
  - I could potentially have the output printed into a txt file should the user want so they could re-read their mad lib later if they wanted.
